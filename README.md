# MNIST_Digit-Classification

This project is to classify a given hand written digit image into 0-9. Dataset is imported from keras library.
Using the concepts of deep learning, a neural network model is developed with one input layer, two hidden layers with relu activation function,
output layer with sigmoid activation funtion.
Using sparse_categorical_crossentropy as loss function and adam optimiser, model is trained which gave a prediction accuracy of 97.39%
Confusion matrix is generated, also heatmap is generated using seaborn library for better visualisation of the predicted and actual values.
